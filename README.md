# This started off as a git-init-sample but ended up being the place Im storing my About Me project for the week 1 in class assignments.
# It has basic HTML and CSS code written by myself along with code from the other week 1 assignments, as well as code from demo videos online. 
# If i can find links to any sources i used in this code i will link them here. Mostly i copy/pasted from the inclass files then added my own trial/error code until i liked the outcome.
